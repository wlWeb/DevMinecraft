To get started modding download ForgeModBuilder-0.1.0.8
  https://github.com/CJMinecraft01/ForgeModBuilder/releases

Run that with the following settings: 
  >New Project
  
  >1.12.1
  
  >Your Project Name you want to have it saved as
  
  >Whatever group name (like your name or nail or whatever)
  
  >14.22.1.2478 - the starred setting
  
  >Project Version - whatever you want I chose 0.0.1 for ultra alpha
  
  >Java Version 1.8
  
  Once you create it'll ask you to set up, say yes. Choose eclipse. Then when opening eclipse choose the eclipse folder
  in the folder you created as your work space. 
  
  This should open your project in eclipse.
  
  Then take this repository and replace the files in 'src' and it'll be the same. A further exploration of the correct
  source control method will be done soon.
  

Some useful documentation. http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

also there are some tutorials here: https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php?title=Main_Page

As a precaution, the problem with using tutorials from sources
focussed on pre 1.9 (or even pre 1.12) is the way that the game registers blocks. Adhering to 1.12 tutorials for now will
attempt at negating potential issues we don't understand.
