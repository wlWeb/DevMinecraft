To get started modding download ForgeModBuilder-0.1.0.8
  https://github.com/CJMinecraft01/ForgeModBuilder/releases

Run that with the following settings: 
  >New Project
  -1.12.1
  -Whatever Project Name
  -Whatever group name (like your name or nail or whatever)
  -14.22.1.2478 - the starred setting
  -Project Version - whatever you want I chose 0.0.1 for ultra alpha
  -Java Version 1.8
  
  Once you create it'll ask you to set up, say yes. Choose eclipse. Then when opening eclipse choose the eclipse folder
  in the folder you created as your work space. 
  
  Voila. 
  
  Then take this repository and replace the files in 'src' and it'll be the same. Smart bois will know a better gitHub
  friendly way of updating this but like. Whatever. I dunno. Sourcecontrol is for dads. I'm but a boi
  

Some documentation on this stuffs. http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

also there are some tutorials here: https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php?title=Main_Page

As a precaution and trying to cover the "Well, you didn't tell me that NAIL" the problem with using tutorials from sources
focussed on pre 1.9 (or even pre 1.12) is the way that the game registers blocks. Just stick with 1.12 tutorials if you're 
looking up how to do stuffs. I will try to cover all questions from here on.
